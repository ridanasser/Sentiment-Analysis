# Sentiment Analysis  

## Description  
This project evaluates the accuracy of different **Natural Language Processing (NLP) models** for sentiment analysis, comparing **FinBERT, FinBERT-tone, and RoBERTa**. Additionally, it assesses classification models like **Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)** to determine the most effective approach.  

## Features  
- Tested **FinBERT, FinBERT-tone, and RoBERTa** for sentiment analysis  
- Evaluated classification models (**LR, SVM, Naive Bayes**) for performance comparison  
- Applied **text preprocessing** and feature extraction for model optimization  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (FinBERT, RoBERTa)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning Models)  
- **NLTK, SpaCy** (Text Preprocessing)  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ridanasser/Sentiment-Analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Sentiment-Analysis

3. Generate the requirements.txt file:

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt

4. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the sentiment analysis script:

   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py

## Usage
- Train and evaluate different sentiment analysis models.
- Modify preprocessing steps or experiment with additional classifiers.
- Use the trained model to analyze sentiment in custom text data.
